    <p class="reasoning">When a function has many parameters, it is often a sign that it is doing too much and should be refactored into smaller parts.</p>
    <p class="reasoning">Each parameter adds to the complexity of a function, and the more it has, the harder it becomes to understand (and use).<br/><br/>A common practice is to bundle parameters into a <code>struct</code> when many parameters are absolutely necessary. This practice, however, does <em>not</em> reduce the complexity of the function- but it <em>does</em> improve its readability.</p>
