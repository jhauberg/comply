    <p class="reasoning">The majority of function prototypes will suffer from having unnamed integer parameters as their meaning can otherwise be difficult to derive.<br/><br/>There are exceptions, of course, a good example is a math function such as <code>max(int, int)</code>. But in general, it is always preferable to provide parameter names.</p>
