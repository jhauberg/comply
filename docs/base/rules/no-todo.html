    <p class="reasoning">These reminders are great for those times where something is not working entirely correctly, but are not important/clear enough to justify writing a full bug report, yet still require a reminder that persist better than a post-it note.<br/><br/>
      However, it is dangerous to <em>todo-and-forget</em>; in time, these reminders may turn stale- the context might be forgotten, or the issue silently fixed- yet the <code>todo</code> remains.<br/><br/>This is a problem, because future-you may no longer understand why, or even <em>what</em>, is wrong. You might not dare deleting it, rendering the <code>todo</code> as nothing but a source of confusion.</p>
