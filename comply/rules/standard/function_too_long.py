class FunctionTooLong(Rule):
    """ Avoid exceeding 40 lines per function.

    A large function can be difficult to read and easily comprehend- especially so if it requires
    scrolling to fully fit on the screen/display of the viewer.
    <br/><br/>
    Basing this rule on a 40 line maximum may seem like an arbitrary number, and while it is
    certainly not a scientifically proven limit, it does represent a viable breaking point where
    most typical displays will be able to keep every line visible.

    Additionally, and similar to <tt>too-many-params</tt>, when a function is getting large and
    increasingly complex, it is also often a sign that it is doing too much and would possibly
    benefit from being refactored into smaller parts.
    <br/><br/>
    However, **do not follow this rule blindly**. There are absolutely times where a long, but linear,
    function is preferable.
